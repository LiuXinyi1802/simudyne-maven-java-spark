This is an agent-based model built based on a chain bankruptcy model from Hamawaki et al.

It has some novelty aspects to improve this model and make it more assess to the real banking system. For instance, it introduce a systemic shock and continuous monitoring the contagion risks in the banking system. In addition it employ a heterogeneous structure and distinguish the different bank sizes.

This model is used to further explore the connectivity and centrality in banking system when facing systemic shocks.
