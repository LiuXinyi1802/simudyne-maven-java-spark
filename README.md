This is an agent-based model built based on a chain bankruptcy model from Hamawaki et al.

It has some novelty aspects to improve this model and make it more assess to the real banking system. For instance, it introduces a systemic shock and continuous monitoring of the contagion risks in the banking system. In addition, it employs a heterogeneous structure and distinguishes the different bank sizes.

This model is used to further explore the connectivity and centrality in the banking system when facing systemic shocks.

#Run the model:

1. Run the Main.java
2. Open the Simudyne Console through http://localhost:8080/
